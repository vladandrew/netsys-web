The NetSys working group was founded in 2010 to enable research in interdisciplinary areas of computer science focusing broadly on **networking**, **theory**, **security** and **operating systems**. The group has attracted joint funding of more than 3 million Euros until now, including two FP7 projects (Change FP7 and Trilogy 2 FP7), two H2020 projects (SSICLOPS and SUPERFLUIDITY), one H2020 ERC Project (Cornet), and two national projects (MobiL4 and MPTCP deployment).

NETSYS is proud to be part of the organizers of the **2018 Research Grants competition** meant to help junior faculty secure early-stage research funding. The deadline for applications is January 31st, 2018. For applications, please visit [this page](http://nets.cs.pub.ro/researchgrants.html).
