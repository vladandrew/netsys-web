 The NETSYS research group focuses on networking and systems research. Its expertise in networking is best seen in the two protocols it has helped design, implement and test: Multipath TCP and NDP. In the broader systems area, the group is working on virtualization (see LightVM paper in SOSP 2017), security (see CHES 2017 paper) and network verification (see Sigcomm 2016).
