The NetSys working group was founded in 2010 to enable research in interdisciplinary areas of computer science focusing broadly on networking, theory, security and operating systems. The group has attracted joint funding of more than 3 million Euros until now, including two FP7 projects (Change FP7 and Trilogy 2 FP7), two H2020 projects (SSICLOPS and SUPERFLUIDITY), one H2020 ERC Project (Cornet), and two national projects (MobiL4 and MPTCP deployment).
